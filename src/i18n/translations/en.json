I also have experience in technical support and helpdesk: troubleshooting, remote assistance, environment setup, software installation, and clear communication with users. I complement my profile with interface design, digital marketing, and SEO optimization.",
      "paragraph3": "I am currently training as a teacher at the Universidad Pedagógica Nacional, also finishing a Bachelor's in Information Systems at the Universidad Nacional de Luján, and participating in an Artificial Intelligence diploma with Google and the Universidad Nacional del Delta. At the same time, I collaborate on real development and training projects, providing personalized classes, creating educational tools, and supporting others on their digital journey. My goal is clear: for technology to become increasingly accessible, useful, and human, in tune with learning, collaboration, and respect for our natural environment."
